Windows 11 Taskbar replacement.
In recent versions of Windows, the taskbar is getting more and more cute, but also less and less productive. There are some alternatives, like virtual desktops, but those are just not fast enough for me.

This taskbar has these features:
- The taskbar is on the left, so you can read window titles.
- It won't group windows, so you can address them individually.
- It will let you redorder all windows with no restrictions.
- A compact clock

Some of these feature were available with 7+ Taskbar Tweaker app, but it is not compatible with Windows 11 anymore.

## Installation
1. Install Autohotkey 1.1
2. Download the AHK script

In order to run just launch the AHK file.
